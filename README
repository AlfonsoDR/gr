GR - a universal framework for visualization applications
=========================================================

GR is a universal framework for cross-platform visualization applications.
It offers developers a compact, portable and consistent graphics library for
their programs. Applications range from publication quality 2D graphs to the
representation of complex 3D scenes.

GR is essentially based on an implementation of a Graphical Kernel System (GKS)
and OpenGL. As a self-contained system it can quickly and easily be integrated
into existing applications (i.e. using the ctypes mechanism in Python).
The GR framework can be used in imperative programming systems or integrated
into modern object-oriented systems, in particular those based on GUI toolkits.
GR is characterized by its high interoperability and can be used with modern
web technologies and mobile devices. The GR framework is especially suitable
for real-time environments.

GIT REPOSITORY
==============

If you want to get the very latest version of GR direct from the
source code repository then you can use git:

    git clone git://ifflinux.iff.kfa-juelich.de/gr
