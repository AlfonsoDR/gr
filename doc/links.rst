Links to talks, tutorials or presentations can be found
`here <http://gr.fz-juelich.de/>`_. Unfortunately, most of them are in
German language.

The GR framework has already been presented in a talk at PyCon DE
`2012 <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/54>`_ and
`2013 <https://2013.de.pycon.org/schedule/sessions/45/>`_, during a
`poster session <https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/158/>`_ at PyCon
US 2013, and at `PythonCamps 2013 <http://josefheinen.de/rasberry-pi.html>`_
in Cologne. The slides for the PyCon.DE 2013 talk can be found
`here <http://gr.fz-juelich.de/talk>`_.

As part of a collaboration there are plans to integrate the GR framework into
`NICOS <http://cdn.frm2.tum.de/fileadmin/stuff/services/ITServices/nicos-2.0/dirhtml/>`_
(a network-based control system completely written in Python) as a replacement
for PyQwt.
