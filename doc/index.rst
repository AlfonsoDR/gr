GR framework documentation
==========================
GR is a graphics framework for plotting data sets and displaying images. It combines 2D and 3D graphics features to provide engineers, scientists and analysts a complete framework for creating visualization applications. GR offers basic and high-level graphic functions for 2D and 3D graphs, surface and contour plots, which can be exported to most popular output formats.

GR is a procedural interface for a device independent graphics library, but it can also be used in object oriented systems. There are bindings for traditional programming languages, but the preferred method is to use GR from Python.
